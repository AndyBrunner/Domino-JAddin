Java Toolkit for IBM Domino server add-in

Do you need to write a Domino addin server task in Java? The JAddin framework is a very thin and convenient layer between the Domino RunJava task and your Java application code. It greatly helps you to create Java server tasks for Domino by freeing you to learn all the Domino addin specifics such as message queue handling, subthread creation, Domino resource cleanup, etc. It is written entirely in Java to support all Domino versions since 8.5 and processor architectures (32-bit or 64-bit) on all platforms.
