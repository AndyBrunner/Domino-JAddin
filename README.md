## Introduction

The open-source JAddin framework serves as a lightweight and user-friendly layer between the HCL Domino RunJava task and your Java application code. It simplifies the creation of Java server tasks by abstracting the complexities of HCL Domino add-in development, such as message queue handling, thread management, console communication, and resource cleanup. Written entirely in Java, JAddin supports all HCL Domino versions and platforms starting from version 9.0.1 FP8 and above.

### **Code Example**

```java
public class HelloWorld extends JAddinThread {

	// Declarations
	boolean terminateThread = false;
	
	// This is the main entry point. When this method returns, the add-in terminates.
	public void addinStart() {
		
		logMessage("Started with parameter: " + getAddinParameters());

		try {
			logMessage("Running on " + dbGetSession().getNotesVersion());
		} catch (Exception e) {
			logMessage("Unable to get Domino version: " + e.getMessage());
		}
		
		// Stay in main loop until termination signal set by addinStop()
		while (!terminateThread) {
			logMessage("User code is executing...");
			waitMilliSeconds(5000L);
		}
		
		logMessage("Terminated");
	}

	// This method is called by the JAddin framework when the command 'Quit' or 'Exit' is entered or during
	// Domino server shutdown. Here you must signal the addinStart() method to terminate itself and to perform any cleanup.
	public void addinStop() {
		
		logMessage("Termination in progress");
		
		// Signal addinStart method to terminate thread
		terminateThread = true;
	}
	
	// This method is called by the JAddin framework for any console command entered.
	@Override
	public void addinCommand(String command) {
		logMessage("You have entered the command: " + command);
	}
}
```
